# numpy_series
numpy course from basic to intermediate

## 01 - Introduction to numpy - Introduction
In this course we'll learn how to use Python for scientific computations using the numpy Module, which is the basic module used in scientific Python. This is a beginner level course as far as scientific Python is concerned, but it's not a beginner level course as far as the Python language itself is concerned. I assume you have at least some basic knowledge of the language.

## 02 - Introduction to numpy - The IPython Console
The IPython console is used to run code interactively. It's an enhanced command-line REPL environment for Python. Some of its features include command history browsing, available even between sessions, input and output caching, autocompletion and more.

## 03 - Introduction to numpy - Magic Functions
In IPython we can use extension commands, known as magic functions. One-line commands are preceded by a single % sign, and commands working on a whole cell are preceded by a double % sign.

## 04 - Introduction to numpy - The Spyder IDE
The Spyder Integrated Development Environment is used to write Python modules and packages as well as run Python code interactively. Through its integration with the IPython console Spyder is especially suitable for working with the scientific libraries.

## 05 - Introduction to numpy - Introduction to Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is a web application in which Python code can be written and executed through a web browser. It's used to run your code, collect the output produced by your code and embed text, graphics, videos, figures and equations, all in one document.

## 06 - Introduction to numpy - The numpy Module
If we want to use Python in science, there is one module all other scientific module make use of, numpy. numpy lets us work on arrays, which in turn lets us repeat computations for a set of values in one go without using the slow for loops that work on each element one by one.

## 07 - Introduction to numpy - The Attributes of a numpy Array
The class that numpy uses for the arrays is the ndarray. An ndarray object contains the data stored in the array but also some other attributes that characterize the array.

## 08 - Introduction to numpy - Data Types
In the previous lecture we were using the dtype attribute of the ndarray class to check the data type of the elements in the array. We know that all elements of a numpy array are of the same type, unlike in a regular Python list, where the elements may but don't have to be of the same type.

## 09 - Introduction to numpy - Creating numpy Arrays with Constant Values
Sometimes we need arrays containing specific data, like constant values, increasing or decreasing values, uniformly spaced numbers, random numbers and so on. To this end we can use quite a lot of functions besides the basic np.array function we've been using so far.

## 10 - Introduction to numpy - Creating numpy Arrays with Spaced Values
If we want to create an array with incremental or decremental values, we can use the np.arange function, which works very much like the built-in range function in Python, or the np.linspace function.
